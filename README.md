# Check prime number 
- `Basic Loop`: Checks for divisibility from `2 to n-1`.
- `Efficient Sqrt Method`: Checks divisibility only up to `sqrt(n)`.
- `6k Â± 1 Optimization`: A more efficient method that skips obvious `non-prime` numbers.
- `Recursive Method`: Uses recursion to check divisibility.
- `Sieve of Eratosthenes`: Efficient for checking all primes in a `range`.
