# Practical Use Cases:

## Iterators:

- How do iterators use borrowing to efficiently process collections?
- Can you explain the concept of iterator adaptors and their relationship to borrowing?

## Function Arguments and Return Values:

- When should you pass arguments by value, by reference, or by mutable reference?
- How can you return references from functions without causing lifetime issues?

## Concurrency and Parallelism:

- How does borrowing interact with threads and synchronization primitives?
- What are the challenges and best practices for using borrowing in concurrent programming?
